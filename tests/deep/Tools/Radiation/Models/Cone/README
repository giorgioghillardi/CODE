To generate new tables for comparison, just create a new 'pi' file with an
inremented name (i.e. if the pi file with the highest number in its name is
'pi1' currently, give the new file the name 'pi2' etc.). Once you have a
working, appropriately named pi file, you can generate the tables by invoking
'gentables.py' (no modification required). Once that is done, just go to the
build directory and rebuild the tests ('make'). That's it.
