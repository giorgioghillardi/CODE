THE ISOTROPIC TEST FOR ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION
-------------------------------------------
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the amount of emitted isotropic
radiation from a given tokamak using a more direct method than the one used by
SOFT (and thus avoid the additional Jacobians etc. that arise in SOFT).

To this end, the amount of radiation received by a detector of given size,
with a given field-of-view, from a single point of space, is evaluated
analytically and then integrated over all of space. The spatial integration,
which is triple integral, is evaluated in cylindrical coordinates.
